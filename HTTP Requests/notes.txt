HTTP Response - Status Codes
    1. Information responses - Hold On
    2. Successful responses - Here you go
    3. Redirection messages - Go away
    4. Client error responses - You messed up
    5. Server error responses - I messed up

Status codes are defined by RFC 9110.


Middlewares
    Preprocess the request - perform various functions on the request before sent
    Logging the request - how long did the request take to come through, status of the request
    Authentication - before we let request through, see if client is authorised
    Process errors in request

Comman middleware in nodeJS and express is body parser.
